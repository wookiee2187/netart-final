    <h1> IDEAS </h1>

    <p>
	A project where the focus could be having a user try to create a social media profile
	    (on something that looks like fb/insta/snapchat) but the glitches 
	    (based on the values they input into a form/randomly), create something unique to them. 
    </p>


    <p>
	I was also thinking of maybe having something like glitch art, 
	    for amazon/fb where when the user is using the platform, 
	    it glitches revealing what the backend is collecting/tracking. 
    </p>

    <p>
	a Web VR game where the user creates profiles on media platforms 
	    (by choosing attributes that are tightly limited) that morph into physical objects, 
	    and then they navigate keeping these beings from fighting/disappearing, s
	    howing the many ways in which social media creates an avatar/personality for us, 
	    that can sometimes be contradictory.
