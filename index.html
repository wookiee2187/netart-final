    <h1> IDEAS </h1>

    <p>
	I thought it would be cool to pursue a project where the focus could be having a user try to create a social media profile (on something that looks like fb/insta/snapchat) but the glitches (based on the values they input into a form/randomly), create something unique to them. 
    </p>


    <p>
	I was also thinking of maybe having something like glitch art, for amazon/fb where when the user is using the platform, it glitches revealing what the backend is collecting/tracking. 
    </p>

    <p>
	a Web VR game where the user creates profiles on media platforms (by choosing attributes that are tightly limited) that morph into physical beings/objects, and then they navigate keeping these beings from fighting/disappearing, showing the many ways in which social media creates an avatar/personality for us, that can sometimes be contradictory.
