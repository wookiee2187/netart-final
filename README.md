# netart-final

My concept revolved around a Tristian Harris video we saw in class, where we learnt about the various methods that social media uses to keep our attention/make us want to come back to their app (here symbolized by a group of people running in a circle, trying to reach for action they think they want to do (the boxes), but which keep them trapped in the world of these big tech companies). I also tried to incorporate the pinterest hook we saw, and some ideas from surveillance capitalism (particularly those of big tech companies trying to 'automate' us). 

I used three.js (instead of Aframe, because I wanted to use a stable third-person perspective that could be more accessible without equipment + easier to test).
